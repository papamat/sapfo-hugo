My name is Fay Exarchou and I created this brand in 2022 when I finished my basic leathercrafting sessions and started crafting minimal leather goods. My intention is to design, produce, deliver and promote my minimalistic, handmade, leather creations while achieving a balanced and creative woklife, after quitting the corporate lifestyle. Taking into consideration that as long as people consume animals, leather is a sustainable, versatile, recyclable and repairable natural material, I seek the best resources to deliver simple yet beautiful designs that will last for many many years.

What I like to work with the most are handbags, mini bags, stationary accessories and small leather surprises. Take a look at the collection or contact me to discuss the possibility of a customized solution, only for you.

Please, keep in mind that leather is a natural material and my products are completely handmade, therefore, there might be differences between the products in the photos and in real life.
