Travelly bag was originally created to fit a mobile phone and a passport, making it your perfect companion for a trip. Soon it was converted to a must-have minimalistic minibag that comes everywhere with you: from the supermarket around the corner to a quick bite or a salty drink over the sea during summer. Available in many colours, also with the possibility of an adjustable strap.
